Neuroscience. AI. Psychiatry.

<!-- I am a computational neuroscientist and psychiatrist, formerly  -->

I have had the privilege of working in several diverse and interesting settings:
<!-- 1. [Fauna Robotics](https://www.linkedin.com/company/fauna-robotics/) is an embodied AI company that builds highly agile, dexterous, natural language-capable consumer-facing companion robots. I helped raise Fauna's seed financing in January 2024 and set vision for the company. -->
<!-- 1. I co-founded [Herophilus](https://www.herophilus.com), a biotechnology company that combined patient-derived stem cell cultures ("organoids") with advanced neuroassays and machine learning for drug discovery. As founding CEO in 2017–2020, I raised $30M in venture financing and hired a team of >40 scientists. Herophilus's technology was sold to Genentech in 2023. -->
<!-- 2. As an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Psychiatry](https://www.columbiapsychiatry.org/profile/g-s-escola-md) and affiliate of the [Center for Theoretical Neuroscience](https://ctn.zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/) at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu), I ran a research lab that studied how natural intelligence can inform artificial intelligence, specifically by examining the neural circuit computations that underlie motor control and learning. We also studied neural network theory and the circuit mechanisms underlying psychopathology. -->
<!-- 3. [Neuromatch](https://neuromatch.io/) is a worldwide 501(c)3 non-profit that is democratizing science by providing high quality education, targeted interactions, career support, and open publishing with zero financial barrier to entry for all. I raised $2M in philanthropy for initial operating capital in 2020–2021 and I served on the Board of Directors (2020–2024). -->

5. I am also a clinical psychiatrist with a small private practice where I see adult patients for medication management and psychotherapy.

Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
