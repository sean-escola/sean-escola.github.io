Neuroscience. AI. Psychiatry.

I am a former assistant professor of psychiatry and affiliate of the Center for Theoretical Neuroscience at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu). My research studies how natural intelligence can inform artificial intelligence, specifically by examining the neural circuit computations that underlie motor control and learning. I also study neural network theory and the circuit mechanisms underlying psychopathology.

I have co-founded two companies and one non-profit:
1. [Fauna Robotics](https://www.linkedin.com/company/fauna-robotics/) is an embodied AI company that builds highly agile, dexterous, natural language-capable consumer-facing companion robots. I helped raise Fauna's seed financing in January 2024 and set vision for the company.
2. [Herophilus](https://www.herophilus.com) is a biotechnology company that combined patient-derived stem cell cultures ("organoids") with advanced neuroassays and machine learning for drug discovery. As founding CEO in 2017–2020, I raised $30M in venture financing and hired a team of >40 scientists. Herophilus's technology was sold to Genentech in 2023.
3. [Neuromatch](https://neuromatch.io/) is a worldwide 501(c)3 non-profit that is democratizing science by providing high quality education, targeted interactions, career support, and open publishing with zero financial barrier to entry for all. I raised $2M in philanthropy for initial operating capital in 2020–2021 and I served on the Board of Directors (2020–2024).

I am also a clinical psychiatrist and I see adult patients with anxiety, depression, ADHD, OCD, and other symptoms for medication management and/or psychodynamic psychotherapy.
