## Virtual neuroscience

The evolution of humans and other animals provides an existence proof for the tantalizing possibility of a foundation model for general intelligence. Notably, the specific driver of the 500 million years of evolution that gave rise to the mammalian brain was the need to solve the problem of sensorimotor control – i.e., the agile control of biomechanical bodies with limited degrees of freedom in the context of noise, sensory feedback delays, and unstructured real environments subject to physics. In contrast, all abstract cognitive phenomena that we think of as the domain of advanced intelligence (language, art, science, games, etc.) arose in merely the last 200 thousand years, an insufficient timespan for substantial evolutionary shaping of neural circuits. In other words, the foundation model for general intelligence is the circuit structure and learning mechanisms underlying sensorimotor control. This provides a roadmap for accelerating research: build artificial systems that robustly solve sensorimotor control in a manner akin to biological systems and then use them both to understand the neuroscience of natural intelligence and as a starting point for developing advanced AI. This is the purpose of Zoo AI, the FRO we propose.

## Goal

The standard academic approach of reductionism has failed to reveal the secrets of ecologically relevant behaviors such as, e.g., social interaction, complex sequence learning and execution, and multi-step memory-guided decision-making on both short and life-long timescales. A hypothesis for this is that the flexibility, robustness, and generalizability that these functions require arise through the constraints of brains needing to control bodies to behave. If so, neural computations must be studied, not via reductionism, but rather in the complex context of the biomechanics of the body and the physics of the world. We can now achieve this in simulation because of the convergence of several technologies:
1. Massively scaled datasets for animals of interest comprising near-complete full-body 3D behavioral ethograms paired with neural physiology and/or casual neural manipulations.
2. High-resolution anatomy (e.g., via micro-CT) for detailed musculoskeletal model design.
3. Fast, flexible physics simulators (e.g., GPU/TPU enabled Mujoco 3.0).
4. Deep RL and imitation learning for training _in silico_ animal models to match the behavior of their in vivo counterparts.

This final point is critical because the evolutionary history described above aligns with Moravec’s paradox: solving sensorimotor control is hard (requiring 500 million years of primate evolution) while tackling cognitive phenomena is relatively easy (requiring just a few hundred thousand years). Imitation learning allows us to skip the first step and build models with the sensorimotor control capabilities of real animals by copying nature’s solution.

These models can then serve many important functions including as:
1. Neuroscience research platforms for scaled hypothesis generation and fully transparent virtual experimentation.
2. Inductive biases for the development of use-specific models (i.e., in the vein of how foundation models for language and vision are used today as starting points for models with domain specificity).
3. Initial solutions for sim-to-real transfer for fully agile robotics platforms.

Developing an _in silico_ zoo – comprising worms, flies, fish, birds, rodents, non-human primates, and humans – would allow the same technical infrastructure to benefit many scientific communities and, critically, will provide a path toward distilling the common principles of sensorimotor control which all animals share and that thus constitute the core of natural intelligence.

## Deliverable

The FRO's explicit deliverable will be a completely novel open-source neuroscience research platform comprising virtual animals of multiple species and tools for experimenting with them. Pre-trained plug-and-play modules will enable users to tune up and down the realism along the brain–body–behavior axis as needed for scientific questions of interest. E.g., options will include (i) constraining part or all of a virtual fly’s brain by the connectome, and (ii) having neural outputs drive joint torques versus muscle activations. APIs will be provided for integrating new (i) behavioral data (for model training), (ii) neural data (for comparison between virtual and real animals), and (iii) biomechanical and neuroanatomical/connectomic data (for adding species). These models will be living repositories for all that we know about the neuroscience of these animals. Such a platform will become the principal driver of discovery in neuroscience and will reposition laboratory experiments to the supporting roles of confirming virtual experiments and guiding model refinement. This would echo the shift in physics to a simulation-first approach.

## Why an FRO

Building virtual neuroscience cannot be achieved within academia because existing funding structures do not have the timescale or risk tolerance for a project of this ambition and because of the multidisciplinary and deep engineering aspects of the project. Whereas academic labs hire mostly within a single discipline, the complexity of our technology stack means that we need to hire scientists and engineers from many backgrounds, including experts in physics simulation, biomechanical modeling, deep RL, generative AI, computational ethology, behavioral data analysis, neural data analysis, computer vision, neural circuit theory, and machine learning infrastructure. This interdisciplinary approach is at odds with the incentive structure of career advancement in academia. Moreover, academic labs have a poor record of attracting the kind of high-value software engineers we require: those who can build and maintain scalable, robust, powerful tools that are also easy to adopt by end users across academic and industry professionals with varying degrees of technical expertise. Of note, while we may or may not collect experimental data within the FRO itself, we will certainly maintain extensive collaborations with academics for 3D videography data paired with neural recordings and/or perturbations, anatomical and biomechanical measurements, and beta-testing and feedback as we build our models. These collaborations will unlock a virtuous cycle, with models directing experiments to questions of high value and the answers to these questions informing model refinement.

A venture-backed robotics company could potentially achieve the more limited goal of developing robust motor control. But the idea of instantiating virtual animals in simulation for the purpose of understanding intelligence generally (as well as motor control) requires a funding commitment for the achievement of a scientific, not a commercial, goal. OpenAI is the most obvious recent point of comparison here, and – though OpenAI now has a valuable product – its initial funding was non-standard and similar in concept to FRO funding. Thus, a company would not be the correct structure for achieving our goals. Importantly though, the FRO funding model imports the ethos from the startup world – which has shown repeated success over recent decades – that the successful development of novel technology that can overturn a status quo demands a rapid decision-making culture that is anathema to the academy.


<!-- ## Equations

This theme supports rendering beautiful math in inline and display modes using [MathJax 3](https://www.mathjax.org/) engine.
You just need to surround your math expression with `$$`, like `$$ E = mc^2 $$`.
If you leave it inside a paragraph, it will produce an inline expression, just like $$ E = mc^2 $$.

To use display mode, again surround your expression with `$$` and place it as a separate paragraph.
Here is an example:

$$
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)
$$

Note that MathJax 3 is [a major re-write of MathJax](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/upgrading/whats-new-3.0.html) that brought a significant improvement to the loading and rendering speed, which is now [on par with KaTeX](http://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php).

## Citations

Citations are then used in the article body with the `<d-cite>` tag.
The key attribute is a reference to the id provided in the bibliography.
The key attribute can take multiple ids, separated by commas.

The citation is presented inline like this: <d-cite key="gregor2015draw"></d-cite> (a number that displays more information on hover).
If you have an appendix, a bibliography is automatically created and populated in it.

Distill chose a numerical inline citation style to improve readability of citation dense articles and because many of the benefits of longer citations are obviated by displaying more information on hover.
However, we consider it good style to mention author last names if you discuss something at length and it fits into the flow well — the authors are human and it’s nice for them to have the community associate them with their work.

---

## Footnotes

Just wrap the text you would like to show up in a footnote in a `<d-footnote>` tag.
The number of the footnote will be automatically generated.<d-footnote>This will become a hoverable footnote.</d-footnote>

---

## Code Blocks

Syntax highlighting is provided within `<d-code>` tags.
An example of inline code snippets: `<d-code language="html">let x = 10;</d-code>`.
For larger blocks of code, add a `block` attribute:

<d-code block language="javascript">
  var x = 25;
  function(x) {
    return x * x;
  }
</d-code>

**Note:** `<d-code>` blocks do not look good in the dark mode.
You can always use the default code-highlight using the `highlight` liquid tag:

{% highlight javascript %}
var x = 25;
function(x) {
return x \* x;
}
{% endhighlight %}

---

## Interactive Plots

You can add interative plots using plotly + iframes :framed_picture:

<div class="l-page">
  <iframe src="{{ '/assets/plotly/demo.html' | relative_url }}" frameborder='0' scrolling='no' height="500px" width="100%" style="border: 1px dashed grey;"></iframe>
</div>

The plot must be generated separately and saved into an HTML file.
To generate the plot that you see above, you can use the following code snippet:

{% highlight python %}
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
df = pd.read_csv(
'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/earthquakes-23k.csv'
)
fig = px.density_mapbox(
df,
lat='Latitude',
lon='Longitude',
z='Magnitude',
radius=10,
center=dict(lat=0, lon=180),
zoom=0,
mapbox_style="stamen-terrain",
)
fig.show()
fig.write_html('assets/plotly/demo.html')
{% endhighlight %}

---

## Details boxes

Details boxes are collapsible boxes which hide additional information from the user. They can be added with the `details` liquid tag:

{% details Click here to know more %}
Additional details, where math $$ 2x - 1 $$ and `code` is rendered correctly.
{% enddetails %}

---

## Layouts

The main text column is referred to as the body.
It is the assumed layout of any direct descendants of the `d-article` element.

<div class="fake-img l-body">
  <p>.l-body</p>
</div>

For images you want to display a little larger, try `.l-page`:

<div class="fake-img l-page">
  <p>.l-page</p>
</div>

All of these have an outset variant if you want to poke out from the body text a little bit.
For instance:

<div class="fake-img l-body-outset">
  <p>.l-body-outset</p>
</div>

<div class="fake-img l-page-outset">
  <p>.l-page-outset</p>
</div>

Occasionally you’ll want to use the full browser width.
For this, use `.l-screen`.
You can also inset the element a little from the edge of the browser by using the inset variant.

<div class="fake-img l-screen">
  <p>.l-screen</p>
</div>
<div class="fake-img l-screen-inset">
  <p>.l-screen-inset</p>
</div>

The final layout is for marginalia, asides, and footnotes.
It does not interrupt the normal flow of `.l-body` sized text except on mobile screen sizes.

<div class="fake-img l-gutter">
  <p>.l-gutter</p>
</div>

## Other Typography?

Emphasis, aka italics, with _asterisks_ (`*asterisks*`) or _underscores_ (`_underscores_`).

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or **underscores**.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
   ⋅⋅\* Unordered sub-list.
3. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
   ⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

- Unordered list can use asterisks

* Or minuses

- Or pluses

[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links.
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org
[1]: http://slashdot.org
[link text itself]: http://www.reddit.com

Here's our logo (hover to see the title text):

Inline-style:
![alt text](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Logo Title Text 1")

Reference-style:
![alt text][logo]

[logo]: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png "Logo Title Text 2"

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        |      Are      |  Cool |
| ------------- | :-----------: | ----: |
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      |   centered    |   $12 |
| zebra stripes |   are neat    |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

| Markdown | Less      | Pretty     |
| -------- | --------- | ---------- |
| _Still_  | `renders` | **nicely** |
| 1        | 2         | 3          |

> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can _put_ **Markdown** into a blockquote.

Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a _separate paragraph_.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the _same paragraph_. -->
